This is a paragraph in markdown. It's separated from the paragraph below with a blank line. If you know HTML, it's kind of like the `<p>` tag. That means that there is a little space before and after the paragraph when it is rendered.
This is a second paragraph in markdown, which I'll use to tell you what I like about markdown. I like markdown because it looks pretty good, if minimal, whether you're looking at the rendered or unrendered version. It's like tidy HTML.
